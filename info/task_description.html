<!-- Describe task in general -->
<img src="{{MEDIA_CONVERT}}title.png" class="title_img" />
<p>
    Find the nearest value to the given one.
</p>
<p>
    You are given an Array of numbers and a value for which you need to find the nearest one.
</p>
<p>
    For example, we have the following sequence of numbers: 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 17,
    and we need to find the nearest value to the number 9. If we sort this sequence
    in the ascending order, then to the left of number 9 will be number 7 and to
    the right - will be number 10. But 10 is closer than 7, which means that the correct answer is 10.
</p>

<p>A few clarifications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If 2 numbers are at the same distance, you need to choose the smallest one;</li>
    <li>The sequence of numbers is always non-empty;</li>
    <li>The given value can be in this sequence, which means that it’s the answer;</li>
    <li>The sequence may contain both positive and negative numbers, but they are always integers;</li>
    <li>The sequence isn’t sorted and consists only unique numbers.</li>
</ul>
